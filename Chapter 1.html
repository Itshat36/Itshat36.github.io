    <h1>I like to go swimming in the summer</h1>
    <p> Swimming is my favorite activity in the summer. when the sun is shinning and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard. its not an impressive pool only three feet deep but its mine</p>
    <p>there are three reasons that I like to swim</p>
    <ul>
    <li> I get lots of exercise</li>
    <li> I enjoy the freedom</li>
    <li> I have an opportunity to be in the sun</li>
    </ul>
