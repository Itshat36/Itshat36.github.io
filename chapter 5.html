    <h1>Muffins the early years</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi my name is muffins. I am a mighty Cat. I was adopted by my family at three weeks old</p>

    <p>My new mommy is a human, they are funny creatures</p>

    <p>I left the pound with my new mommy and new sister, Misty. They took me straight to the pet store to buy food!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A Kitty with a baby bottle and formula</li>
        <li>A small cloth toy</li>
        <li>Litter box with litter</li>
        <li>food(for later)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>mom and sis had to feed me by bottle because I was so young</p>
