		<p>Survivor Stories</p>
			<p>Seeing the parade of motorcycles from all over the United States was super exciting.
			They brought pins and patches from all over the United States and put them on a sash to decorate my wheelchair. 
			After so many days of pain and boredom, seeing the Cycle Out Cancer riders was a real thrill!  ~ Jennifer</p>
			
			<p>I spent 10 days in the hospital just crying.  The Cycle Out Cancer guys were so colorful
			and generous.  They gave the hospital a very generous donation in my name and showed me
			that even strangers care about me. ~ Kristen</p>
			
			<p>I had the good fortune to meet several Cycle Out Cancer guys. Everyone has been touched 
			by cancer.  They are out there doing something about it. ~ Fritz</p>
			
			<p>As soon as my treatments are over, I'm getting a Spyder motorcycle to ride with Cycle Out Cancer.</p>
			Can't wait! ~ Scott</p>
